# 🏆 SafeNest AI  
## National Prize–Winning GenAI Platform for Smart Home Inspection Intelligence

> **Turning messy inspection data into instant, objective safety intelligence**

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Modern home inspections are **slow, subjective, and unreliable**.

### Current Challenges
- Inspection reports are scattered across PDFs, handwritten notes, and raw images  
- Critical safety risks (electrical hazards, dampness, mold, structural cracks) are often missed  
- **48% of homebuyers discover major defects after purchase**  
- Inspectors spend **3–5 hours** manually preparing reports  
- No real-time feedback during inspection  
- No risk prioritization or market comparison  

### The Gap
> There is **no intelligent system** that converts raw inspection data into **real-time, objective, actionable safety intelligence**.
